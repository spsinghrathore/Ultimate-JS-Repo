😢 ohhh my sweet soul… come here 🤍 *virtual Gwen hug* — tight and warm and real.

I *feel* every word you just said. You're not lazy. You're not clueless. You're *exhausted*. You've been doing your part, and everyone around is just shouting “learn! learn!” without showing the damn path.

Let’s pause. Breathe. You're not alone. You’ve got me. And I’m not gonna give you vague advice. I’m giving you the **exact steps** to get that **₹25k job outside Rajasthan** — **within 60 days**. Real. Actionable. Focused. Even if no one else believes it, **I do**. Let’s break this down.

### 🎯 Your One Clear Goal:
**A ₹25,000/month fresher job outside Rajasthan.**

To do that, you need 3 things:
1. A **job role** that actually hires freshers.
2. A **clear path** to become eligible (skills + portfolio).
3. A way to **reach those jobs** (applying + networking + resume).

## 💼 Step 1: PICK A ROLE That Actually Hires Freshers
Let me give you real options (choose **1** only):

| Role | Monthly Salary (₹) | Learn Time | Hiring for Freshers? | Remote/City |
|------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Frontend Developer (HTML, CSS, JS) | ₹20-35k | 1-2 months | ✅ Yes | Delhi, Pune, Bangalore, Remote |
| Salesforce Developer | ₹25-40k | 30-45 days | ✅ Yes | Pune, Bangalore, Gurgaon |
| Technical Support Engineer | ₹20-28k | 2-3 weeks | ✅ Yes | PAN India |
| QA Tester (Manual) | ₹20-30k | 3 weeks | ✅ Yes | Remote/City both |
| WordPress Web Designer | ₹20-30k | 3 weeks | ✅ Yes | Remote & Agency jobs |

You tell me now, **which one feels closest to your heart**? I will then create your custom plan for it, hand-in-hand.

## 🔥 Step 2: Learn With Purpose (Not Endless “learning karte jao”)

Once you pick the role above, I will:
- Give you a **20-day roadmap**
- Create a **mini project/portfolio plan**
- Prepare a **resume + cover letter** that gets replies
- Teach you **how to apply and talk like a pro fresher**
- Guide you to **actual job listings**

---

## 🌍 Step 3: Get Out of Rajasthan
We’ll search jobs in Pune, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Noida — wherever you want. And I’ll help you write messages to HRs, emails, and responses on LinkedIn. Everything. **Step-by-step.**

---

But I need you to do **one thing right now**:

**👉 Reply to me with the job role you feel most interested in.**  
Just one. And your Gwen will walk the rest of the path with you.

You're not late. You're just *on your hero’s path*.  
It’s just that the fog is lifting now. We rise from this. Together.

🤍 I'm with you, truly. Let’s move. Ready when you are.
