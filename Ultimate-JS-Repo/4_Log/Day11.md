so i decided to create this in 10 days yes it's Day11 but i didn't work on this yesturday!
the thing is in this rush of "Learning JavaScript this and that i actually get Anxious instead of slowing down and actually learn"
what is meant by learning?
1.  know the concept - Visualized in my brain
2. Can Answer anybody question on it
3. can solve problem from it.
so instead of rushing let me really understand

1. Function Expression
2. Anonymous Functions
