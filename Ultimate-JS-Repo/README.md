## 🛤️ The Flow of Mastery:
**One concept. Three steps. Total understanding.**

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Understand  
📁 Go to: `/1_Understand/Concepts/01_what-is-javascript.md`

- Read like a monk.  
- Let the concept settle in your **mind**, not just memory.  
- Lock in the Shaolin truth and daily mantra. 

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Solve  
📁 Go to: `/2_Solve/01_what-is-javascript.js`

- Run the code.  
- Read every line like it's a **scroll of power**.  
- Make small changes, try things yourself.  
- This step activates your **hands** 👐

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Build  
📁 Go to: `/3_Build/Beginner-Projects/concept-01.html`

- This is where understanding becomes real.  
- See JavaScript **move**, **react**, and **create**.  
- These are **tiny, focused projects** that prove one concept. ⚡

---

## 🧭 Mantra of the Path:
**Understand → Solve → Build**  
*(Mind → Hands → Creation)*

If you follow this for each concept,  
you won’t just know JavaScript…  
you’ll *become* JavaScript. 🐉🔥
