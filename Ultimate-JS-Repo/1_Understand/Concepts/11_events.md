## 🌀 Scene 1: The Echo of Footsteps

The warrior stood in silence, the calm before the storm.

But the silence was not empty.

He could feel it:

- The mouse shifted on the screen.
- A key was pressed on the keyboard.
- A button was hovered over.
- A form was submitted.

These weren’t just actions. They were **whispers of the world**.

The world called for **action**, and the warrior needed to **respond**.

He reached for the **Event Scroll**, prepared to listen...

## 🧭 Scene 2: What is an Event?

An **event** is any **action** or **occurrence** that can be detected and responded to by JavaScript. It could be a user interaction, like a mouse click or key press, or a system-generated event, like the page finishing loading.

### Common Event Types:

| Event Type | Triggered When... |
| --- | --- |
| `click` | The mouse clicks an element 🖱️ |
| `keydown` | A key is pressed ⌨️ |
| `submit` | A form is submitted 📤 |
| `mouseover` | The mouse hovers over an element 🕊️ |
| `scroll` | The user scrolls the page 🧭 |

## 🧙‍♂️ Scene 3: The Listener Technique

To react to an event, you must **listen** for it using the **event listener** technique.

You use the `addEventListener()` method to attach an event listener to an element.

```javascript
element.addEventListener("event", function);
```

### Example Scroll:

```html
<button id="summon">Summon Power</button>

<script>
  const btn = document.getElementById("summon");

  btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("⚡ Your power has been summoned!");
  });
</script>
```

Here:

- `"click"` is the event being listened to (the user clicking the button).
- The **arrow function** is the **reaction** — what happens when the button is clicked (in this case, an alert).

> 🧠 **Master Tip**: The event (like `click`) is the trigger, and the function is your response.

## 🎒 Scene 4: The Event Object – The Messenger

Every event that happens brings an **event object**, a sacred scroll that contains **details** about the event:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event); // Contains all details: position, target, type...
});
```

The `event` object contains **critical information** about the event:

- `event.target` → The element that triggered the event (e.g., the button clicked)
- `event.type` → The type of event (e.g., `click`)
- `event.key` → The key pressed (for keyboard events like `keydown`)

## 🛡️ Scene 5: Preventing Chaos

Sometimes, the default action triggered by an event must be stopped.

For example, if a form is submitted, the page might refresh. You can **prevent this** by using `preventDefault()`:

```javascript
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevents form submission from refreshing the page
  console.log("Form intercepted!");
});
```

By calling `e.preventDefault()`, you stop the form from submitting and the page from refreshing, giving you complete control.

> You now control whether the river flows… or stays still.

## 🗡️ Hidden Ability Unlocked: **Reaction Jutsu**

You’ve now unlocked the art of **event-driven power**:

- **React** to **clicks**, **keys**, **scrolls**, and other events.
- Use `preventDefault()` to **stop unwanted actions**.
- Utilize the **event object** to gather **details** and make smarter decisions.
