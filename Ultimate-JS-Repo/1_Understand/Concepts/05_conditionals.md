## 🌀 Scene 1: The River of Flow

Imagine your code as a river.

It flows from top to bottom — always.

Unless...

you place a **stone**.

Or split the stream into two paths.

Or make it **loop back**.

That is **Control Flow** — the art of controlling how your code runs.

```
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");

```

This flows straight.

But…

```
if (enemyAppears) {
  fight();
} else {
  meditate();
}

```

Now, you’ve **split the river**.

It depends on **a decision**.

## The Blade of Choice – `if`, `else`, and `else if`

In the dojo of logic, there is one rule:

> “You must choose the truth, and the truth will choose the path.”
> 

```
let energy = 100;

if (energy > 80) {
  console.log("Perform Dragon Strike");
} else if (energy > 40) {
  console.log("Use Wind Style");
} else {
  console.log("Retreat and meditate");
}

```

JavaScript checks **each truth**, top-down.

The moment it finds truth, it **stops**.

##  The Balance Test – Comparison Operators

To decide, you must compare.

Here are your tools:

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |
| `==` | Equal (loose) |
| `===` | Equal (strict) |
| `!=` | Not equal |
| `!==` | Not equal (strict) |

Use **`===`** like a true warrior — strict, sharp, and precise.

Do not use `==` unless you know its illusions (type coercion).

##  The Multiple Gateways – `switch` Case

Sometimes, you have many choices.

```
let technique = "fire";

switch (technique) {
  case "water":
    console.log("Flow gently");
    break;
  case "fire":
    console.log("Burn fiercely");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown path");
}

```

The `switch` is a gate with many doors.

Only the right key opens the right path.

---

##  The Path That Repeats – Loops (Sneak Peek)

There is one more twist in the flow...

Sometimes, you must walk the same path again and again — until a condition changes.

That is the **Loop**.

We’ll explore it deeper in the next scroll.

## ⚔️ Hidden Ability Unlocked: **Path Shaper**

You now command:

- The flow of code with `if`, `else`, and `switch`
- The truth with comparison operators
- The direction of destiny inside your programs

## 🛠️ Path of Action: Practice Begins

1. Try writing logic that decides:
    - If a user is logged in or not
    - What type of warrior enters (based on rank)
    - If your energy is high enough to train
