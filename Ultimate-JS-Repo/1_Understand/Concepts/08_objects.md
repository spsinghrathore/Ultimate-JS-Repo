# 🎬 **EPISODE 08 – The Mask of Memory: Objects**

## 🌀 Scene 1: The Shrine of Echoing Names

In the misty ruins, the Master presents a wooden mask.

> “This is not just a face,” she says.
> 
> 
> “It’s a **memory**.”
> 

She places it in your hand, and the wood glows:

```
let warrior = {
  name: "Hanzo",
  clan: "Shadow Leaf",
  level: 42,
  isAwake: true
};

```

A whisper: *“You have created… a soul.”*

## 🧠 What Is an Object?

An **Object** is a **collection of key-value pairs** — like a scroll of identity.

```
let potion = {
  type: "Healing",
  strength: "High",
  used: false
};

```

It’s a way to group related data under **one name**.

Just like a warrior is not just a name — they have traits, thoughts, and a story.

---

## Accessing the Mask’s Memory

To speak to the mask:

```
console.log(warrior.name);      // Hanzo
console.log(warrior["clan"]);  // Shadow Leaf

```

To change something:

```
warrior.level = 43;

```

To add something new:

```
warrior.weapon = "Katana";

```

To delete a memory:

```
delete warrior.isAwake;

```

> You can give and take memory… but only with respect.

##  Objects Within Objects

Objects can hold **Arrays**, other **Objects**, and even **functions**.

```
let dojo = {
  name: "Sky Peak",
  location: {
    region: "East",
    altitude: 9000
  },
  masters: ["Raiku", "Tetsu"],
  train() {
    console.log("Training begins at dawn.");
  }
};

```

Call a method:

```
dojo.train(); // "Training begins at dawn."

```

> The dojo is alive. It trains. It speaks.
>

## 🎓 Why Use Objects?

- To represent **real-world entities**: people, items, places
- To group related data under one roof
- To **organize code like a storyteller**, not just a scribe
