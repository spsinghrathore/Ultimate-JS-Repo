# 🎬 **EPISODE 10 – THE HAND THAT TOUCHES THE WORLD: The DOM Nodes**

*“True power is not just in thinking... but in changing what you see.”*

## 🌀 Scene 1: The Wall Between Worlds

The warrior steps into the **DOM Temple** and stands before the mighty **tree of the page** — **the DOM Tree**.

Each leaf of this tree is a **node** in the DOM. Every element on the page, from the **header** to the **buttons**, from the **images** to the **paragraphs**, is a node.

Now, the warrior seeks to **understand** and **manipulate** these nodes to shape the page, to bend the world of the code.

> The DOM is not just a document.  
> It’s a **tree of nodes**.  
> And every node can be **accessed**, **modified**, and **changed** with JavaScript.

## 🌳 Scene 2: The Living Tree of Nodes

In the DOM, **everything** is a **node**. From the page’s structure to the text inside it. It’s like a tree where:

- **Element Nodes** represent HTML tags (like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`)
- **Text Nodes** represent the text inside those tags
- **Attribute Nodes** represent attributes (like `id`, `class`, `src`)

Visualize this:

```html
<body>
  <h1 id="title">Welcome, Warrior</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the dojo.</p>
</body>
```

The DOM tree looks like this:

```
Document
└── body
    ├── h1 (Element Node)
    │   └── Text (Node)
    └── p (Element Node)
        └── Text (Node)
```

### Nodes in Action:

1. **Element Node:** Every HTML element is a node — `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`.
2. **Text Node:** The content inside an element is a node — "Welcome, Warrior" in the `<h1>`.
3. **Attribute Node:** Attributes like `id="title"` inside the `<h1>` tag are also part of the DOM.

## 🧠 Scene 3: The Sacred Techniques of Node Manipulation

Now that we understand the structure, let’s explore the sacred techniques to **access** and **modify** these nodes:

| Technique | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `document.querySelector()` | Finds **one** element node by a CSS selector 🎯 |
| `document.querySelectorAll()` | Finds **many** element nodes (NodeList) 💫 |
| `element.textContent` | Changes **text nodes** 📝 |
| `element.setAttribute()` | Modifies an **attribute node** 🎨 |
| `element.appendChild()` | Adds a new **node** to an element 🏯 |
| `element.removeChild()` | Removes a **child node** from an element 🔪 |

---

## 🔧 Scene 4: The Scroll of Movement

Now, the warrior must use these techniques to manipulate the DOM nodes.

### Example 1: **Accessing a Node**

```javascript
const title = document.querySelector("#title"); // Get the h1 element
console.log(title.textContent); // Logs the text inside <h1> (Welcome, Warrior)
```

### Example 2: **Changing Text of a Node**

```javascript
title.textContent = "You have leveled up!";
```

### Example 3: **Changing an Attribute (ID)**

```javascript
title.setAttribute("id", "newTitle"); // Change id of the <h1> element
```

### Example 4: **Appending a Child Node**

```javascript
const newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "You are now a true warrior!";
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph); // Add the new <p> element to the body
```

### Example 5: **Removing a Child Node**

```javascript
const oldParagraph = document.querySelector("p");
document.body.removeChild(oldParagraph); // Remove the first <p> element
```

## 💡 Scene 5: Why the DOM Nodes Matter

Understanding and manipulating **DOM nodes** allows you to:

- **Access** and change the structure and content of the page
- **Add new elements** or **remove** unwanted ones
- **Modify attributes**, styles, and text dynamically

The **DOM Tree** is your playground. With mastery over it, you can **reshape the page** to your will.

## 🧘‍♂️ Shaolin Wisdom

> "The warrior knows the tree.  
> He does not just observe.  
> He **touches** the leaves. He **shapes** the branches.  
> And in that touch, he transforms the world."

With **DOM Node** mastery, you gain the power to **transform** not only the page but also the **interaction** the user has with it.

## 🗡️ Hidden Ability Unlocked: **Control Over the Tree**

You now have the ability to:

- **Navigate** the DOM tree.
- **Modify** elements, text, and attributes.
- **Add** or **remove** nodes to change the structure of the page.
- **Create interactive** elements that react to user actions.
