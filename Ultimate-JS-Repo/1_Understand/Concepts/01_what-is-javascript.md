## 🔍 Understand

JavaScript is a **programming language** used to make **webpages dynamic and interactive**.

Without JavaScript:
- Websites are like posters (static).
With JavaScript:
- They become apps (alive, responsive, powerful).



| Element     | Role              |
|-------------|-------------------|
| HTML        | The bones         |
| CSS         | The skin & style  |
| JavaScript  | The brain & soul  |

JavaScript **runs in your browser** (like Chrome, Firefox) and also on **servers** (with Node.js).  
It’s the **only language all browsers speak**.

This is the **force** behind everything you click, type, and feel on the web.
