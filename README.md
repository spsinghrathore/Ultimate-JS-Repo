## 🌱 Why This Exists

Because learning JavaScript is often confusing.  
Too many tutorials. Too little mastery.

So this repo is different.

It’s built for those who want to:

- 🧠 Understand deeply  
- ⚔️ Solve fearlessly  
- 🔨 Build confidently  
- 📜 Log honestly

## 🛡️ The Path of the Dragon

We follow 3 core steps — no fluff, no skipping.

### 🧠 1. Understand

Start from the roots.  
Know how JavaScript works — memory, variables, scope, execution, async, everything.  
Not to memorize. To **see it clearly** in your mind.

📁 Go to: `/1_Understand`  
Each folder has:
- `Concept.md` — deep explanation  
- `Practice.md` — hands-on questions  
- `Notes.md` — your own memory map

---

### ⚔️ 2. Solve

Turn knowledge into power.  
Every concept becomes a blade when you solve with it.

📁 Go to: `/2_Solve`  
Problems are organized by:
- Topic: Arrays, Objects, Loops, Async...
- Level: Beginner → Advanced  
- Bonus: Most Asked Interview Questions

---

### 🔨 3. Build

No better way to learn than to create.  
From tiny components to full-stack apps — one step at a time. No templates. No copy-paste. All yours.

📁 Go to: `/3_Build`  
Includes:
- Tiny Projects (start here)  
- Real-World Components  
- Full Mini-Apps  
- Build Challenges

---

### 📜 4. Log

Your **Battle Journal**.

Every day you study, solve, or build — write it down.  
You’ll look back and realize: you *became a dragon*.

📁 Go to: `/4_Log`  
Add your daily:
- Wins
- Breakthroughs
- Fails
- Lessons

---

### 💼 5. Interview

You’re not just learning for fun.  
You’re here to get that job.  
Face the top questions. Learn how to talk like a developer.

📁 Go to: `/5_Interview`  
Includes:
- Most asked JS Questions (with answers)  
- HR Round Prep  
- Projects to show  
- Questions to ask the interviewer
